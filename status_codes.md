Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:

`200` — Everything went okay, and the server returned a result (if any). </br>
`301` — The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or when an endpoint's name has changed.</br>
`401` — The server thinks you're not authenticated. This happens when you don't send the right credentials to access an API.</br>
`400` — The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don't send the information that the API requires to process your request (among other things).</br>
`403` — The resource you're trying to access is forbidden, and you don't have the right permissions to see it.</br>
`404` — The server didn't find the resource you tried to access.</br>
